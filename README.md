# Spring_online_grocery_buying_and_selling_mobileapp
Identifying the issues that are pain-points for the farming community, we came up with this initiative to lend them a helping hand - Spring , an app that promotes direct trade between the seller and the consumer without middlemen, warehouse or other lengthy distribution channels.  Through this app, consumers can order fresh, local, farm produce online and the items will be directly delivered to the consumers in eco â€“friendly sustainable packaging from the farm. Not only the large-scale but the small-scale cultivators are also promoted and the consumer category includes not only the retailers but also the bulk vendors.
